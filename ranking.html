          <h1>Saving Private Ryan</h1>
          <h2>Director: Stephen Spilberg</h2>
          <h2>Release Date: July 24th, 1998</h2>
          <h2>Staring: Vin Diesel, Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore</h2>
          <p>
          	Not just another great action movie, Saving Private Ryan is often regarded as the
          	essential World War II movie. The movie manages to bring the viewer as close to the action
          	as possible and make it feel so real without needing the viewer to have
          	actually seen or experienced these monumentus events. The opening D-Day sequence is the
          	pinnacle of this, showing not only bombastic action and strong moments of hereoism and leadership,
          	but also showing the brutality of the war with numerous gruesume deaths and dismemberment. The movie
          	keeps this tone all the way to the end and portrays our portagonists as soldiers trying to complete their
          	mission and maintain as few casualties as possible rather than as larger than life heros. On top of this,
          	all the scenes of the actual war are portrayed as a flashback of a veteran visting fallen comrades at
          	a cemetary, once again showing the reality and cost of war. Overall, this movie is my favorite World War II
          	flick due to its strict portrayol of reality and well directed, well acted, action sequences.

          <h1>American Beauty</h1>
          <h2>Director: Stephen Spilberg</h2>
          <h2> Release Date: October 1st, 1999</h2>
          <h2>Staring: Kevin Spacey, Thora Birch, Wes Bently</h2>
          <p> This one ended up being a pleasent suprise for me, saying as I had never heard of the movie
          	until I watched it. In short, the movie is about several characters who fight the constructs
          	that either themselves or society has put them in.  The characters all go through a similar
          	transition even though they vary significantly. From middle-age man trying to add more joy into
          	his life, to a strict conservative veteran coping with homosexual feelings, to an angsty teenager
          	trying to find her way in the world. The most notable character though is Ricky Fitts, a high
          	school teenager who is looked down upon in the begining for not conforming to normal social constructs but in reality,
          	Ricky is the only one who is truely happy and at peace with who he is which is what everyone else is seeking.

          <h1>Back To The Future</h1>
          <h2>Director: Roberth Zemeckis</h2>
          <h2> Release Date: July 3rd, 1985</h2>
          <h2>Staring: Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd</h2>
          <p>
          Back to the Future manages to make a thrilling sci-fi movie that is also
          sleek and cool with a lot of good laughs throughout.  Marty McFly, played
          by the charismatic stud Michael J. Fox. Match him with the crazy scientist
          who's life goal was acheiving time travel played by  the eccentric
          Christopher Lloyd. The two play off each well mixed with a romp through time
          with goofs and gafs along the way and we have a timeless (lol) comedy.

          <h1>Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back</h1>
          <h2>Director: Irvin Kershner</h2>
          <h2> Release Date: June 20th, 1980</h2>
          <h2>Staring: Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher</h2>
          <p> Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back is a matserpeice in multiple
              ways. For one, it does a great job of world building. Even with the tremendous
              amount of different planets and life-forms in the Universe of
              Star Wars, each one feels appropriate and believable within the world.
              Another stand out aspect of the movie are the characters. From the
              always lovable, yet sassy droids, to Han Solo and Chewbacca's smuggler
              duo just trying to get by, to Luke wanting to learn the ways of the Jedi while
              being conflicted by the fact that his friends lives are in danger. All these aspects
              come together to make the movie as a whole even better than the sum of its
              masterfully created and well though out parts.
